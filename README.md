## üìù Content Creation

Blog articles are stored in the `src/content/_articles` directory, written in Markdown format. Each article needs to include frontmatter metadata, for example:

```markdown
---
title: 'Article Title'
description: 'Article Description'
date: '2023-01-01'
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2']
---

Article content...
```

Recommended guidance for each frontmatter field:

- `title`: Write a concise, engaging headline that includes primary keywords so search engines and feeds surface the article accurately while enticing readers to click.
- `description`: Provide a one- or two-sentence summary highlighting the article's main takeaway; this powers SEO meta descriptions and helps social previews communicate value quickly.
- `date`: Use the ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to keep chronological sorting predictable across the site, archives, and any automated deployments.
- `tags`: Choose 3‚Äì5 specific topical labels that reflect the article's themes; consistent tagging keeps related posts grouped and improves search and filter relevance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

The blog can be easily customized through the configuration file located at `src/config/site.ts`. This allows you to modify:

- Blog name and basic information
- Header navigation menu items
- Footer links and sections
- Social media links
- SEO metadata and favicon
- Algolia search configuration

Example configuration:

```typescript
// src/config/site.ts
export const siteConfig = {
  name: "Your Blog Name",
  title: "Your Blog Title",
  description: "Your blog description",
  author: "Your Name",

  // Navigation menu
  nav: [
    { name: "Home", path: "/" },
    { name: "About", path: "/about" },
    // Add more menu items
  ],

  // Footer links by section
  footerLinks: [
    {
      title: "Social Media",
      links: [
        { name: "Github", url: "https://github.com/yourusername" },
        // Add more links
      ]
    },
    // Add more sections
  ],

  // SEO configuration
  seo: {
    meta: {
      keywords: "keyword1,keyword2",
      description: "Site description"
    }
  },

  // Algolia search configuration
  algolia: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    applicationId: "your-application-id",
    indexName: "your-index-name",
    lang: "en"
  }
}
```

## üåê Deployment Strategy

The project uses a Vercel + Cloudflare deployment approach:

1. **Vercel**: Provides continuous integration and deployment services; each time code is pushed or an article is added, deployment is automatically triggered
2. **Cloudflare**: Through setting up CNAME records and Cloudflare's CDN, enables access acceleration for domains without ICP filing in China

### Deployment Steps

1. Import GitHub repository on Vercel
2. Configure build command `pnpm build`
3. Set environment variables (if needed)
4. Set up custom domain
5. Add domain in Cloudflare and set CNAME record pointing to the domain provided by Vercel
